# SolarPlatform
The project is a simulation platform code. The propose of this project is to create a code for the SCRS((solar central receiver systems). The project is divided into three parts: the raytracing code and a convolution model and a GUI  interface.

# Development Tool

 - VS 2015
- cuda 8.0
- C++ 11
- Qt 5.0

# TODO

- convolution model

# Reference

The ray tracing code is from a previous projects: https://github.com/XiaoyueDuan/SolarEnergy
